                        When we first got the assignment to make a homemade switch with LED lights, the night view of
                        Manhattan's night view came to mind. We came up with the concept of 'paying 50 cents to see
                        Manhattan's at night view'. Then we decided to use LED lights to make the skylineManhattan's night
                        view and to use a coin as a conductor. The coin would be used as a switch to turn on the light.

                    <p>
                        First, we drew a schematic in which 8 LED lights are connected in a series. Following this
                        schematic, we assembled the components. However, the lights did not turn on. We assumed that
                        itthis wasis due to the high voltage that the eight lights were not working.

                    <p>
                        To solve the problem in the first schematic, we tried to divide the 8 LED lights into two
                        sectionsparts of 4 LED lights each and connected them to the 9V battery.

                    <p>
                        Next, we attempted it with a parallel connection instead of a serial connection. We didn’t
                        consider the switch while assembling it. So even though the LED lamps were operating, the
                        link wasn’t suitable for a homemade switch.

                    <p>
                        We connected the LED lights incorrectly with regard to regarding the plus(anode) and minus
                        sides(cathode), which resulted in the lights not working. What we first attempted with the
                        LED lights was + - - + + - - + …. . However, we had misunderstood the current flow. Weand
                        fixed the issue by setting upputting the LED lights correctly later on the fourth attempt.
                        Later wWe changed the direction of the LED lights to + - + - + - + - ….

                    <p>
                        We tried a serial connection, but the power was not strong enough to make more than 4 LED
                        lights work. Out of 8 LED lights in a row, only 4 seemed to be fully working. This is why we
                        came up with a revised schematic system and returned to the combination of parallel
                        connections using two switches. In conclusion, this problem occurred becauseas we didn’t
                        fully understand the structure of the breadboard.

                        Later we found out it was the issuematter of the direction of the current that made the LED
                        lights not bright enough. Later we found out that the reason the LED lights weren’t bright
                        enough was the issue of the direction of the current. We made two working switches with one
                        battery (power source) by readjusting and organizing the resistors, wires, LED lights, and
                        switches.

                        Overall the light was not strong enough to create make the “Manhattan at night” effect we’d
                        imagined. There washad been an issue withof positioning the light with the window of the building to
                        make proper light eliminating effect through the window. It was difficult to position the lights in
                        the windows of the buildings to create the proper effect of light shining through the windows.

To make improvements, we decided to develop the structure design and use code written using Arduino and a micro conductor. This time we wrote code using Arduino and its JS library so that the LED light can be turned on gradually when the button is pressed.

                        We created a new Manhattan skyline illustration to address the issue of the previous project, dim led lights in a light room. To increase the brightness of the LED lights, we built a box-shaped frame around the city graphic to generate a shadow, which allows the artwork to stay black, making the LED lights look brighter.

                After learning about how to use a buzzer and a photoresistor in class, we are asked to create a simple application with either sound or movement as an output.

                        The doomsday clock shows the time left till doom. But with our action - covering the small piece of nature (with photoresistor inside) with our hand - it can stop the clock ticking and eventually stop doomsday. For this ideation, we decided to use a motor, buzzer, and photoresistor.

                                Our attempt on connecting the servo motor and photoresistor was successful. However, we couldn’t get the 360-degree turn using this motor, so we changed to another motor.

                        When we tried to run the motor with the switch and it turned out successful. However, the code we applied only worked when we put speed on the terminal. We later changed it so that it works purely with the switch.

                                We connected the motor to the light sensor with the revised code, and we were able to make the speed of the motor sensitive to the light. When we covered it with our hands, the motor slowed down and eventually stopped. Now it was time to connect.

                                It turned out the TONE function interferes with specific pins - 3 and 11, so we changed the pin number 11 to 6. After the update on the code as well, both motor and buzzer started working. After we succeed in this, we moved on to creating a prototype.

                    When we were testing the prototype, there was a slight delay in restarting both the buzzer and motor, which we have not figured out yet. When we increase the frequency of the buzzer, the delay disappeared. We thought that it has something to do with speed and frequency.

                <p class="grid-box">
                    When trying to debug, we first examined all the connections on the breadboard and then the code. After we found no apparent errors, we thought that it was because the power supply was not strong enough. However, we tested a few methods to increase the power and it was still not working. Eventually, we found out through Google that only certain ports can be used for the motor. Our conclusion is that it’s helpful to switch perspectives when one debugging direction is not working out.

                        FSRs are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight. They are simple to use and low cost. The FSR is made of 2 layers separated by a spacer. The more one presses, the more of those Active Element dots touch the semiconductor and that makes the resistance go down.

                        FSRs are basically a resistor that changes its resistive value (in ohms Ω) depending on how much it is pressed. These sensors are fairly low cost, and easy to use but they're rarely accurate. When you use FSRs you should only expect to get ranges of response.

                        Most wireless chargers use magnetic induction and magnetic resonance. They offer the promise of being able to place a device on a surface  and have it charge automatically—no fiddling with cables required.<br><br>
                        Wireless charging isn’t truly wireless, of course. Your phone, smart watch, tablet, wireless headphones, or other device doesn’t need to be plugged into the charger with a wire, but the wireless charger itself still has to be plugged into a wall outlet to function.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Despite it's downside, it still can be useful in specific cases.</p><br>

                    <p>
                        Wireless chargers typically use magnetic induction. The short explanation is that they use magnetism to transmit energy. First, you place the device–like a smartphone—on the wireless charger. The current coming from the wall power outlet moves through the wire in the wireless charger, creating a magnetic field. The magnetic field creates a current in the coil inside the device sitting on the wireless charger. This magnetic energy is converted to electrical energy, which is used to charge the battery. Devices must have the appropriate hardware in them to support wireless charging—a device without the necessary coil can’t charge wirelessly.
