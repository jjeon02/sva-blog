                        When we first got the assignment to make a homemade switch with LED lights, the night view of
                        Manhattan's night view came to mind. We came up with the concept of 'paying 50 cents to see
                        Manhattan's at night view'. Then we decided to use LED lights to make the skylineManhattan's night
                        view and to use a coin as a conductor. The coin would be used as a switch to turn on the light.

                    <p>
                        First, we drew a schematic in which 8 LED lights are connected in a series. Following this
                        schematic, we assembled the components. However, the lights did not turn on. We assumed that
                        itthis wasis due to the high voltage that the eight lights were not working.

                    <p>
                        To solve the problem in the first schematic, we tried to divide the 8 LED lights into two
                        sectionsparts of 4 LED lights each and connected them to the 9V battery.

                    <p>
                        Next, we attempted it with a parallel connection instead of a serial connection. We didn’t
                        consider the switch while assembling it. So even though the LED lamps were operating, the
                        link wasn’t suitable for a homemade switch.

                    <p>
                        We connected the LED lights incorrectly with regard to regarding the plus(anode) and minus
                        sides(cathode), which resulted in the lights not working. What we first attempted with the
                        LED lights was + - - + + - - + …. . However, we had misunderstood the current flow. Weand
                        fixed the issue by setting upputting the LED lights correctly later on the fourth attempt.
                        Later wWe changed the direction of the LED lights to + - + - + - + - ….

                    <p>
                        We tried a serial connection, but the power was not strong enough to make more than 4 LED
                        lights work. Out of 8 LED lights in a row, only 4 seemed to be fully working. This is why we
                        came up with a revised schematic system and returned to the combination of parallel
                        connections using two switches. In conclusion, this problem occurred becauseas we didn’t
                        fully understand the structure of the breadboard.

                        Later we found out it was the issuematter of the direction of the current that made the LED
                        lights not bright enough. Later we found out that the reason the LED lights weren’t bright
                        enough was the issue of the direction of the current. We made two working switches with one
                        battery (power source) by readjusting and organizing the resistors, wires, LED lights, and
                        switches.

                        Overall the light was not strong enough to create make the “Manhattan at night” effect we’d
                        imagined. There washad been an issue withof positioning the light with the window of the building to
                        make proper light eliminating effect through the window. It was difficult to position the lights in
                        the windows of the buildings to create the proper effect of light shining through the windows.

                        We created a new Manhattan skyline illustration to address the issue of the previous project, dim led lights in a light room. To increase the brightness of the LED lights, we built a box-shaped frame around the city graphic to generate a shadow, which allows the artwork to stay black, making the LED lights look brighter.
