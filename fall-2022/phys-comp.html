                        When we first got the assignment to make a homemade switch with LED lights, the night view of
                        Manhattan's night view came to mind. We came up with the concept of 'paying 50 cents to see
                        Manhattan's at night view'. Then we decided to use LED lights to make the skylineManhattan's night
                        view and to use a coin as a conductor. The coin would be used as a switch to turn on the light.

                    <p>
                        First, we drew a schematic in which 8 LED lights are connected in a series. Following this
                        schematic, we assembled the components. However, the lights did not turn on. We assumed that
                        itthis wasis due to the high voltage that the eight lights were not working.

                    <p>
                        To solve the problem in the first schematic, we tried to divide the 8 LED lights into two
                        sectionsparts of 4 LED lights each and connected them to the 9V battery.

                    <p>
                        Next, we attempted it with a parallel connection instead of a serial connection. We didn’t
                        consider the switch while assembling it. So even though the LED lamps were operating, the
                        link wasn’t suitable for a homemade switch.

                    <p>
                        We connected the LED lights incorrectly with regard to regarding the plus(anode) and minus
                        sides(cathode), which resulted in the lights not working. What we first attempted with the
                        LED lights was + - - + + - - + …. . However, we had misunderstood the current flow. Weand
                        fixed the issue by setting upputting the LED lights correctly later on the fourth attempt.
                        Later wWe changed the direction of the LED lights to + - + - + - + - ….

                    <p>
                        We tried a serial connection, but the power was not strong enough to make more than 4 LED
                        lights work. Out of 8 LED lights in a row, only 4 seemed to be fully working. This is why we
                        came up with a revised schematic system and returned to the combination of parallel
                        connections using two switches. In conclusion, this problem occurred becauseas we didn’t
                        fully understand the structure of the breadboard.

                    <p>
                        Later we found out it was the issuematter of the direction of the current that made the LED
                        lights not bright enough. Later we found out that the reason the LED lights weren’t bright
                        enough was the issue of the direction of the current. We made two working switches with one
                        battery (power source) by readjusting and organizing the resistors, wires, LED lights, and
                        switches.

                        Overall the light was not strong enough to create make the “Manhattan at night” effect we’d
                        imagined. There washad been an issue withof positioning the light with the window of the building to
                        make proper light eliminating effect through the window. It was difficult to position the lights in
                        the windows of the buildings to create the proper effect of light shining through the windows.

                        We created a new Manhattan skyline illustration to address the issue of the previous project, dim led lights in a light room. To increase the brightness of the LED lights, we built a box-shaped frame around the city graphic to generate a shadow, which allows the artwork to stay black, making the LED lights look brighter.

                        The doomsday clock shows the time left till doom. But with our action - covering the small piece of nature (with photoresistor inside) with our hand - it can stop the clock ticking and eventually stop doomsday. For this ideation, we decided to use a motor, buzzer, and photoresistor.

                                Our attempt on connecting the servo motor and photoresistor was successful. However, we couldn’t get the 360-degree turn using this motor, so we changed to another motor.

                        When we tried to run the motor with the switch and it turned out successful. However, the code we applied only worked when we put speed on the terminal. We later changed it so that it works purely with the switch.

                                We connected the motor to the light sensor with the revised code, and we were able to make the speed of the motor sensitive to the light. When we covered it with our hands, the motor slowed down and eventually stopped. Now it was time to connect.

                                It turned out the TONE function interferes with specific pins - 3 and 11, so we changed the pin number 11 to 6. After the update on the code as well, both motor and buzzer started working. After we succeed in this, we moved on to creating a prototype.

                    When we were testing the prototype, there was a slight delay in restarting both the buzzer and motor, which we have not figured out yet. When we increase the frequency of the buzzer, the delay disappeared. We thought that it has something to do with speed and frequency.

                <p class="grid-box">
                    When trying to debug, we first examined all the connections on the breadboard and then the code. After we found no apparent errors, we thought that it was because the power supply was not strong enough. However, we tested a few methods to increase the power and it was still not working. Eventually, we found out through Google that only certain ports can be used for the motor. Our conclusion is that it’s helpful to switch perspectives when one debugging direction is not working out.

                        FSRs are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight. They are simple to use and low cost. The FSR is made of 2 layers separated by a spacer. The more one presses, the more of those Active Element dots touch the semiconductor and that makes the resistance go down.

                        FSRs are basically a resistor that changes its resistive value (in ohms Ω) depending on how much it is pressed. These sensors are fairly low cost, and easy to use but they're rarely accurate. When you use FSRs you should only expect to get ranges of response.

                        Most wireless chargers use magnetic induction and magnetic resonance. They offer the promise of being able to place a device on a surface  and have it charge automatically—no fiddling with cables required.<br><br>
                        Wireless charging isn’t truly wireless, of course. Your phone, smart watch, tablet, wireless headphones, or other device doesn’t need to be plugged into the charger with a wire, but the wireless charger itself still has to be plugged into a wall outlet to function.

                        Wireless chargers typically use magnetic induction. The short explanation is that they use magnetism to transmit energy. First, you place the device–like a smartphone—on the wireless charger. The current coming from the wall power outlet moves through the wire in the wireless charger, creating a magnetic field. The magnetic field creates a current in the coil inside the device sitting on the wireless charger. This magnetic energy is converted to electrical energy, which is used to charge the battery. Devices must have the appropriate hardware in them to support wireless charging—a device without the necessary coil can’t charge wirelessly.

                <p class="grid-box">
                    Does anyone remember the excitement of sitting in front of the TV and waiting for our favorite show to start? Does anyone remember collecting branches and rags to play as the character that we admired as kids? This project is inspired by that inner child of ours. Time will pass, but emotions stay. Looking back, we might laugh at our silliness, yet we will always feel reminiscent about how simple things could bring us so much happiness.
                    <br><br>
                    With those thoughts in mind, we drew inspiration from one of our childhood favorite shows: Card-captor Sakura. By mimicking the signature Sakura gesture, we want to create an interactive project that represents the magic-wand experience to bring our audience a moment of happiness and amazement. 
                    <br><br>
                    The idea is that when the user waves the magic wand, magical effects will happen on the screen and surprise the users.

                    <p>
                        The input will be the pressure sensor because the user will use the magic wand to press the sensor and trigger the animation. The output will be a p5.js animation on a laptop screen because this results from the interaction (what the users will see).
                    </p><br>
                    <h6>Revised</h6>
                    <p>We decided to change the FSR sensor to an accelerometer that can detect x,y,z axis in space. Thus, the input will be the accelerometer value, and the output will be the moving 3D graphic on p5.js.</p>

                        When the participant hit the wand and triggers the pressure sensor, it shows the ‘magic circle’ on the screen using p5.js. The magic circle can be created using loop function, and the sensor can trigger the opacity.

                            FSRs are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing, and weight. They are simple to use and low-cost. The FSR is made of 2 layers separated by a spacer. The more one presses, the more of those Active Element dots touch the semiconductor and that makes the resistance go down.
                            <br><br>
                            FSRs are basically resistors that change their resistive value (in ohms Ω) depending on how much they are pressed. These sensors are fairly low-cost and easy to use but rarely accurate. When you use FSRs, you should only expect to get a range of responses.

            <p>After the class, we decided to use a sensor that can actually detect the x,y,z axis that can be attached to the wand itself. We decided not to use the pressure sensor, but instead figured out what other sensor we could use.</p>

                <p class="grid-box">
                    We attempted to use the Arduino Nano, but it wasn’t receiving any variables from the sensor, and the Arduino program had trouble recognizing the board. After several tests, we moved to another sensor.

                            We were able to use an accelerometer and succeeded in getting x,y, and z axis variables from the Arduino program. For the p5.js output, we added for-loop-animation on the background and a 3D object that can be adjusted by the sensor. After a few tests, we succeeded in making p5.js output but couldn’t figure out how to connect them with sensor input.

                <p class="grid-box">
                    For some reason, handshake wasn’t working for our code (the accelerometer was not sending values to p5). It worked after we removed the handshake part in Arduino and p5.

                            Our code was supposed to send three values to p5, but we didn’t fully understand the process and kept trying to send only one value. This was a prior failure while connecting the Arduino and p5. <br><br>
                            With Eric and Viola’s help, we made a 3D object interact with the accelerometer. After setting up the accelerometer, uploading Arduino code, and setting up p5.js, we tested whether it works.

                    <p>
                        Playing with sensor was very fun. When one sensor didn’t work out, we were quick to seek an alternative solution.
                        <br><br>
                        First, we started by connecting 2D-based p5. animation with a pressure sensor to space-responsive 3D p5 work. We succeeded in making the 3D object responsive to physical movement. However, it was not moving as smoothly as we wanted. 
                        <br><br>
                        In the future, we would like to find out what’s causing the lag, and make 3D object show a smooth movement with clear visual presentation.

                    <strong> To utilize Arduino for replacing 3 mouse functions and displaying the result via p5.js.</strong>
                    We used the translate function(axis x, axis y) and the left click of a mouse as the 3 functions for this project. The potentiometer strip controls the axis x, the potentiometer controls y, and the push button works like a mouse click.
